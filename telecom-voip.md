## Prompt  
Explain how latency, jitter, and packet loss affect VoIP call quality in telecom networks.

## Response  
Latency refers to the delay between voice transmission and reception. High latency causes noticeable gaps in conversation. Jitter is the variation in packet arrival times, which can lead to choppy audio or out-of-order speech. Packet loss occurs when data packets fail to reach their destination, resulting in missing words or dropped calls. Together, these factors degrade VoIP quality and require network optimization to maintain clarity and reliability.
