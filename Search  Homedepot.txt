  Scenario: Search Functionality works as expected
#        Given I land of the Home Depot Page
#        Then I should see a cool slider
#        When I type "Drills" into the search bar
#        And I click search Icon
#        Then I should see matching result
    Given I open url "https://www.homedepot.com/"
    Then I wait for element with xpath "//div[@id='hero-carousel']" to be present
        # We still need to assert it\
#        When I click on element with xpath "//input[@id='typeahead-search-field-input']"
#        And I wait for 3 sec
    When I type "Drills" into element with xpath "//input[@id='typeahead-search-field-input']"
    When I click on element with xpath "//button[@id='typeahead-search-icon-button']"
    And I wait for 3 sec
    Then element with xpath "//img[@title='Image for UP TO 35% OFF']" should be present
