👋 Welcome! I'm a QA & Service professional with experience testing web, mobile, and networked applications across cloud and on‑premise environments. This repo demonstrates hands-on QA practice with tools like Postman, SQL, ADB, and Selenium. 

> 📌 **Update: Added AI Prompt Samples**  
This repo now includes structured prompt-response files under `PromptSamples/`, showcasing telecom troubleshooting, QA logic, and multi-turn AI reasoning.  
Use this branch (`ai-prompt-samples`) to explore hybrid skills in QA and prompt engineering.

## 🧪 Highlights:
- API Testing with Postman  
- Backend validation with SQL  
- Mobile testing with ADB  
- Basic automation with Selenium  
- Manual test cases & bug tracking  

## 💡 AI Prompt Samples
This section includes examples of structured prompt-response pairs designed for AI training and evaluation. Each sample demonstrates clarity, multi-step reasoning, and domain-specific insight across telecom, QA, and general knowledge.

- Prompt engineering for AI model refinement  
- Domain-specific Q&A creation (telecom, CS, economics)  
- Multi-step reasoning and structured responses
