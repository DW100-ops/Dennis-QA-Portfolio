# Firmware Trace Recovery Template

## Purpose
Reduce diagnostic time during embedded QA and firmware rollout. Targets trace drift, fragmentation, and normalization across NetAct, EdenNet, and custom QA platforms.

## Setup
- Environment: Linux-based embedded systems
- Tools: CLI access, trace capture utility, timestamp sync module

## Usage
1. Run trace capture: `trace_dump.sh`
2. Normalize timestamps: `sync_trace.py`
3. Identify drift: `grep -E 'ERROR|WARN' trace.log`
4. Apply rollback logic from `recovery_notes.md`

## Highlights
- Reduced trace recovery time by 40% in remote QA scenarios
- Adaptable to fragmented embedded platforms
- Used in Tier 1 carrier deployments

## Files Included
- `trace_recovery_template.txt`: CLI prep sheet and recovery steps
- `sample_trace.log`: Example trace output (anonymized)
- `recovery_notes.md`: Notes on drift correction and rollback logic
