## Prompt  
Simulate a multi-turn reasoning process where an AI helps a user choose between two job offers based on salary, remote flexibility, and long-term growth.

## Response  
**User:** I have two job offers. One pays $90K with full remote, the other pays $105K but is hybrid.  
**AI:** Let's break it down. Do you value remote flexibility more than the extra $15K?  
**User:** Yes, I prefer working from home.  
**AI:** Then the $90K remote role aligns better with your lifestyle. What about long-term growth—any differences?  
**User:** The hybrid role has clearer promotion paths.  
**AI:** If growth is a priority, the hybrid role may be worth the commute. Otherwise, the remote role offers better daily autonomy.  
**User:** I’ll take the remote one.  
**AI:** Great choice for flexibility. You can revisit growth options later with freelance or side projects.
