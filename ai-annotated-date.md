## Prompt  
Describe how annotated data improves the performance of supervised machine learning models.

## Response  
Annotated data provides labeled examples that guide the model during training. In supervised learning, each input is paired with a correct output, allowing the model to learn patterns and relationships. High-quality annotations reduce ambiguity and improve accuracy. For example, labeling telecom support tickets by issue type helps a classifier distinguish billing problems from technical faults. The more consistent and relevant the annotations, the better the model generalizes to new data.
